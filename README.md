# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Prabhdeep Brar**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

**CalcDebug** is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  **In this app every single section crashed the app for whatever reason so we had to utilize the debugger and figure out what was the errors its also a pretty interesting app utilizing kotlin fundamentals.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **🥶😎🧠**
